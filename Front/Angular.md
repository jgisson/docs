# Angular Documentation

## TLDR: setup in 2025
- Use Angular CLI
- Use Signals and Zoneless
- UI -> Materiels and Tailwind
- Testing:
  - Keep Jasmine and Karma (Only Karma will be replaced, the runtime)
  - Use Playwright for e2e
- Guide lines:
  - Angular-Eslint
  - Format via Prettier in lint-staged and Husky
- Use inject instead of Contructor dependency Injection
- Package manager: Use pnpm

## 1. Introduction

### What is Angular?
Angular is a popular open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It enables developers to build dynamic, scalable, and maintainable single-page applications (SPAs) using TypeScript and a component-based architecture. Angular provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for client-side development, making it suitable for projects of all sizes.

### Key Features and Benefits
- **Component-based architecture:** Promotes modularity and reusability by organizing UI into self-contained components.
- **TypeScript support:** Offers strong typing, modern JavaScript features, and improved developer productivity.
- **Powerful CLI:** The Angular CLI streamlines project setup, development, testing, and deployment.
- **Dependency injection:** Simplifies service management and improves testability.
- **Built-in routing:** Facilitates navigation and deep linking within applications.
- **Comprehensive tooling:** Includes support for forms, HTTP client, state management, and more.
- **Active community and ecosystem:** Backed by Google and a large developer community, ensuring regular updates and extensive resources.
